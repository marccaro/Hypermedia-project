# HYPERMEDIA PROJECT

 # Project Analysis
-  TARGET USER PROFILE
The targeted user of this project is any company looking for candidates with solid programming skills in low-level languages like C/C++/Rust/Assembly and in-depth knowledge of operating systems. 
- INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
This is Curriculum Vitae single page website. As it can be appreciated the two parts are differentiated by the color. One the personal information and the other one the skills and titles.
-  VISUAL DESIGN 
I opted for a very minimalist 2 colors approach. Light-Blue(Cyan) for my personal information and Light-Grey for my titles and skills
